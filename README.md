# Las rosas IOT

Refactoring of the previous project lasrosasiot-old.

I wrote this applicaiton to manage the events coming from my Lorawan sensors at home (a farm) top 
manage the water tanks levels, temperature....

The refactoring objectives are:
- use the Clean/Hexagonal design principles I just put in place on a customer's project.
- allow a smooth integration with HomeAutomation.
- modularize the code
- since I dockerized my infrastructure, it will use docker for the deployment

It's an on-going work.
